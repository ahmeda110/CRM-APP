# ABOUT
When launched a login page is promted where users can login/register. Then, depending on the account permissions a user will be redirected to an admin or customer dashboard. Within the admin dashboard, a UI presents the count of total, pending and delivered orders. Admins also have the power to view all customers and products. Moreover, customers can be added/removed, and when clicked on a user their information is readily presented where the admin can update their information; this includes: updating/adding/removing orders, personal information, as well as filtering for a specific order (by name, status, date). On the other hand, the customer dashboard lists their orders along with the status and count of delivered vs pending. Finally, all the above is connected to a SQL database.
